# API Overview

The Guard Agent API provides a comprehensive, protocol-driven architecture for enterprise-grade security telemetry. Designed with extensibility and reliability at its core, the API enables seamless integration with diverse monitoring ecosystems while maintaining strict performance guarantees.

## System Architecture

The agent implements a layered architecture optimized for high-throughput telemetry collection with minimal application impact:

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Handler (`GuardAgentHandler`)

The central orchestration component responsible for coordinating all telemetry operations.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- **Lifecycle Management**: Orchestrates initialization, operation, and graceful shutdown sequences
- **Event Processing**: Implements high-throughput event ingestion with backpressure handling
- **Metric Aggregation**: Performs efficient metric collection with configurable sampling rates
- **Task Coordination**: Manages asynchronous operations including buffer flushing and policy synchronization

**Basic Usage (Auto-integrated with FastAPI Guard):**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from guard import SecurityConfig, SecurityMiddleware

# Configure with agent enabled
config = SecurityConfig(
    enable_agent=True,
    agent_api_key="your-api-key",
    agent_project_id="your-project-id",
    agent_endpoint="https://api.guard-core.com",
)

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware, config=config)
# Agent starts automatically with middleware
```

**Direct Usage (Advanced):**

Only for a process with no framework adapter (fastapi-guard, flaskapi-guard, djapi-guard, tornadoapi-guard) enabling the agent through `SecurityConfig`. Doing this alongside an adapter with `enable_agent=True` builds a second singleton that never receives traffic. `guard_agent()` dispatches to `SyncGuardAgentHandler` from sync module-load context but to `GuardAgentHandler` from the middleware's async init, so the events you send here don't reach the dashboard.

```python
from guard_agent import guard_agent, AgentConfig

# Initialize directly
config = AgentConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project_id="your-project-id",
)
agent = guard_agent(config)

# Lifecycle
await agent.start()
await agent.stop()

# Send data manually
await agent.send_event(security_event)
await agent.send_metric(performance_metric)
```

### 2. Event Buffer (`EventBuffer`)

High-performance buffering subsystem engineered for optimal throughput and reliability.

**Technical Capabilities:**
- **Lock-Free Architecture**: Utilizes deque-based storage for minimal contention
- **Persistent Buffering**: Optional Redis integration for durability across restarts
- **Intelligent Flushing**: Adaptive algorithms balance latency and efficiency
- **Concurrency Safety**: Full async/await compatibility with thread-safe operations

**Usage Patterns:**

```python
from guard_agent.buffer import EventBuffer
from guard_agent.models import AgentConfig, SecurityEvent

# Create buffer (sizing comes from AgentConfig.buffer_size / flush_interval)
config = AgentConfig(api_key="your-api-key")
buffer = EventBuffer(config, flush_callback=None)

# Optional Redis durability
await buffer.initialize_redis(redis_client)

# Add events
await buffer.add_event(security_event)
await buffer.add_metric(performance_metric)

# Manual flush
events = await buffer.flush_events()
metrics = await buffer.flush_metrics()
```

### 3. HTTP Transport (`HTTPTransport`)

Enterprise-grade network layer implementing industry best practices for reliable data delivery.

**Reliability Features:**
- **Intelligent Retry**: Deterministic exponential backoff (no jitter), capped at 60s per delay
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failure detection with graceful degradation
- **Fixed Rate Limiting**: Client-side sliding window (100 req/60s); server `429 Retry-After` is honored separately
- **Comprehensive Telemetry**: Real-time transport statistics for operational visibility

**Configuration:**

```python
from guard_agent.transport import HTTPTransport
from guard_agent.models import AgentConfig

# Retry, timeout, and backoff all come from AgentConfig
config = AgentConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    endpoint="https://api.guard-core.com",
    timeout=30,
    retry_attempts=3,
    backoff_factor=1.0,
)
transport = HTTPTransport(config)
```

### 4. Data Models

Strongly-typed data structures leveraging Pydantic for validation and serialization.

**Primary Models:**
- `AgentConfig`: Comprehensive configuration with validation and defaults
- `SecurityEvent`: Rich security event representation with contextual metadata
- `SecurityMetric`: Performance metrics with dimensional tagging support
- `EventBatch`: Optimized batch container for network efficiency
- `AgentStatus`: Real-time operational telemetry and health indicators

### 5. Protocol System

Clean abstraction layer enabling custom implementations while maintaining compatibility.

**Protocol Interfaces:**
- `AgentHandlerProtocol`: Defines agent lifecycle and event handling contracts
- `BufferProtocol`: Specifies buffering semantics and performance guarantees
- `TransportProtocol`: Establishes network transport requirements and capabilities
- `RedisHandlerProtocol`: Standardizes persistent storage integration patterns

    def __init__(
        self,
        config: AgentConfig,
        flush_callback: Callable[[], Awaitable[None]] | None = None,

```

### Models API

#### Core Data Models

##### AgentConfig

```python
class AgentConfig(BaseModel):
    api_key: str
    endpoint: str = "https://api.guard-core.com"
    project_id: str | None = None
    buffer_size: int = 100
    flush_interval: int = 30
    enable_events: bool = True
    enable_metrics: bool = True

    retry_attempts: int = 3
    timeout: int = 30
    backoff_factor: float = 1.0

    compression_enabled: bool = True
    compression_threshold: int = 1024

    project_encryption_key: str | None = None
    # ... additional fields
```

##### Compression fields

- `compression_enabled` (default `True`) — when set, the agent gzip-compresses every outgoing batch body whose JSON exceeds `compression_threshold` bytes and sends it with `Content-Encoding: gzip`. Smaller bodies skip compression. The Guard Core SaaS decompresses gzip request bodies via `GzipRequestMiddleware` before pydantic validation. Set `compression_enabled=False` only if your ingestion endpoint does not handle `Content-Encoding: gzip` request bodies.
- `compression_threshold` (default `1024` bytes) — minimum body size in bytes before gzip kicks in. Tune lower for chatty deployments, higher to save CPU on small batches.

##### Retry-After

429 responses raise `RateLimitedError(retry_after_seconds)`; the transport sleeps that exact value (capped at 300s) before retrying instead of falling back to client-side exponential backoff.

##### Rules polling contract (conditional GET)

Every call of `get_dynamic_rules` (the engine's poll, every engine interval) makes this GET; there is no ttl short-circuit, and concurrent calls share one in-flight request and its result. The agent's own rules loop skips its call only while the last successful check (a 200 or a 304, never an error or a fallback to the cache) is younger than `dynamic_rule_interval`, so a standalone agent still polls every interval. Once it holds a rule set from a 200 response it makes the poll conditional. Every agent family and the SaaS follow this contract.

- The agent sends the query params `last_rule_id` and `last_rule_version` of the rule set it holds. Both always travel together, never the version alone, because synthetic rule sets reuse versions.
- When the last 200 response carried an `ETag`, the agent also sends `If-None-Match` with that exact value. Without an `ETag` it sends no `If-None-Match`.
- The first poll, and every poll before a 200 has been received, carries none of these.
- `304` means unchanged: the agent keeps its cached rules, restarts the cache window (`_rules_last_update` is refreshed) and does not count a rules fetch. A 304 is its own path, never an error and never retried. A 304 with no rules held is logged as a warning and yields no rules.
- `200` replaces the held rule set and its `ETag` (the `ETag` is dropped when the response has none). A SaaS that ignores the params and the header and always answers 200 behaves exactly as v3.2.4.
- Any other failure (5xx, timeout, network error, 401 or 403) is retried with backoff up to `retry_attempts`. A permanent 4xx (400, 404, 422) is never retried. Whenever the fetch fails and rules are held, `get_dynamic_rules` returns the cached rules.
- Stale rules: when the SaaS has failed for longer than the cached rules' `ttl` since the last successful check, the agent keeps serving the cached rules, logs one WARNING when they become stale and again every hour while they stay stale (rule id, version, seconds since the last successful check), and one INFO line on the first successful check afterwards. `AgentStatus.rules_stale` and `AgentStatus.rules_last_checked` (time of the last 200 or 304) report it; both default so an older payload stays valid.
- `ttl` of a rule set is clamped into `[60, 86400]` seconds on load and a missing or null `ttl` becomes `300`; a response is never rejected for its `ttl`.

##### SecurityEvent

```python
class SecurityEvent(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime
    event_type: str
    ip_address: str = ""
    action_taken: str = ""
    reason: str = ""
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    # ... additional fields
```

##### SecurityMetric

```python
class SecurityMetric(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime
    metric_type: Literal[
        "request_count",
        "response_time",
        "error_rate",
        "bandwidth_usage",
        "threat_level",
        "block_rate",
        "cache_hit_rate",
    ]
    value: float
    endpoint: str | None = None
    tags: dict[str, str] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    # ... additional fields
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Deployment

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from guard import SecurityConfig, SecurityMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

# Configure FastAPI Guard with agent
config = SecurityConfig(
    # Enable agent
    enable_agent=True,
    agent_api_key="your-api-key",
    agent_project_id="your-project-id",

    # Security settings
    enable_rate_limiting=True,
    enable_ip_banning=True,
    enable_penetration_detection=True,
)

# Add middleware - agent starts automatically
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware, config=config)
```

### Pattern 2: Custom Event Integration

Patterns 2 through 4 below build a standalone agent with `guard_agent(AgentConfig(...))`. That is only safe in a process with no adapter middleware enabling the agent through `SecurityConfig`: combined with Pattern 1 in the same process, `guard_agent()` returns a different singleton (`SyncGuardAgentHandler` from sync context vs. the middleware's `GuardAgentHandler`), and events sent through it never reach the dashboard.

```python
from guard_agent import guard_agent, AgentConfig, SecurityEvent
from guard_agent.utils import get_current_timestamp

# Get agent instance
config = AgentConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project_id="your-project-id",
)
agent = guard_agent(config)

async def custom_security_check(request):
    """Custom security validation with event reporting."""

    if is_suspicious(request):
        # Create custom event
        event = SecurityEvent(
            timestamp=get_current_timestamp(),
            event_type="custom_rule_triggered",
            ip_address=request.client.host,
            action_taken="blocked",
            reason="Custom security check failed",
            endpoint=str(request.url.path),
            method=request.method,
            metadata={
                "check_type": "business_logic",
                "severity": "high"
            }
        )

        # Send to agent
        await agent.send_event(event)

        return False

    return True
```

### Pattern 3: Performance Monitoring

```python
from guard_agent import guard_agent, SecurityMetric
from guard_agent.utils import get_current_timestamp
import time

# Get agent instance (singleton)
agent = guard_agent(AgentConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project_id="your-project-id",
))

async def monitor_endpoint_performance():
    """Monitor endpoint performance and send metrics."""

    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        # Your endpoint logic
        result = await process_request()

        # Success metric
        await agent.send_metric(SecurityMetric(
            timestamp=get_current_timestamp(),
            metric_type="response_time",
            value=time.time() - start_time,
            endpoint="/api/process",
            tags={"status": "success"}
        ))

        return result

    except Exception as e:
        # Error metric
        await agent.send_metric(SecurityMetric(
            timestamp=get_current_timestamp(),
            metric_type="error_rate",
            value=1.0,
            endpoint="/api/process",
            tags={"error": str(type(e).__name__)}
        ))
        raise
```

### Pattern 4: Health Monitoring

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Application health check including agent status."""

    agent_healthy = await agent.health_check()
    agent_status = await agent.get_status()

    return {
        "status": "healthy" if agent_healthy else "degraded",
        "agent": {
            "status": agent_status.status,
            "events_sent": agent_status.events_sent,
            "last_flush": agent_status.last_flush,
            "buffer_size": agent_status.buffer_size
        }
    }
```

## Reliability Patterns

### Graceful Degradation

The agent implements comprehensive failure isolation to protect application availability:

```python
try:
    await agent.send_event(event)
except Exception as e:
    # Agent failure doesn't break your app
    logger.warning(f"Agent error: {e}")
    # Application continues normally
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

Advanced failure detection with automatic recovery mechanisms:

```python
# Circuit breaker state machine:
# - CLOSED: Normal operation with request forwarding
# - OPEN: Fast-fail mode preventing backend overload
# - HALF_OPEN: Controlled recovery testing with limited traffic
```

### Retry Strategies

Sophisticated retry algorithms optimize for both reliability and backend protection:

```python
# Retry configuration (delay = backoff_factor * 2**attempt, capped at max_delay):
retry_attempts: 3                # Retries after the first try (~retry_attempts + 1 total attempts)
backoff_factor: 1.0              # Multiplier on the hardcoded 2**attempt growth
max_delay: 60                    # Caps maximum retry delay (no jitter)
```

## Performance Engineering

### Memory Optimization

Strategic memory management for various deployment scales:

- **Buffer Sizing**: Dynamic sizing based on traffic patterns and memory constraints
- **Flush Strategies**: Adaptive algorithms balance latency requirements with efficiency
- **Persistent Buffering**: Redis integration for memory-constrained environments

### Network Optimization

Advanced techniques minimize bandwidth and latency:

- **Intelligent Batching**: Adaptive batch sizes based on network conditions
- **Compression**: Automatic gzip compression for payload optimization
- **Connection Management**: HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive connection pooling

### Deployment Profiles

```python
# Microservice deployment (low memory, high frequency)
config = AgentConfig(api_key="your-api-key", buffer_size=100, flush_interval=10)

# Standard API service (balanced profile)
config = AgentConfig(api_key="your-api-key", buffer_size=100, flush_interval=30)

# High-throughput gateway (optimized for volume)
config = AgentConfig(api_key="your-api-key", buffer_size=100, flush_interval=5)
```
